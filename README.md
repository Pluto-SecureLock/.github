# 🔐 Pluto-Secure – Encrypted Password Manager for Microcontrollers

> A professional embedded security project developed in CircuitPython for the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect.

**Pluto-Secure** is an experimental password and credential manager built from scratch to demonstrate secure design and encryption practices in constrained environments. It leverages CircuitPython and cryptographic modules to store, encrypt, and retrieve passwords securely.

This project is part of a professional portfolio to showcase full-cycle secure embedded development.

## 🎯 Project Goal

> Build a complete, secure password vault from concept to implementation, demonstrating secure architecture, cryptography, and hardware integration.

## 📐 Phase 1: Requirements Engineering

### ✅ Current Functional Requirements (MVP)

1. Store passwords securely in onboard flash memory.
2. Encrypt passwords using AES-CBC with a user-supplied master key.
3. Retrieve stored passwords only with correct authentication.
4. Store the master key securely using **hash + salt**.
5. Provide a password suggestion tool:
   - Custom length
   - Customizable character set: letters, numbers, symbols

### 🧩 Future Requirements

6. Automatically identify which key to provide based on login page or context.
7. Associate usernames and passwords with services or sites.
8. Enable local password management with optional user accounts.
9. Optional display-based UI (OLED or small screen).
10. Secure export/import of encrypted data.

## 🛡️ Phase 2: Threat Modeling

Following the **STRIDE** model:

| Threat | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|------|------------|
| **Spoofing** | Unauthorized access to secrets | Salted hash comparison of master key |
| **Tampering** | Modification of saved credentials | AES-CBC encryption with per-entry IV |
| **Repudiation** | Lack of traceability | (Planned) Optional logging system |
| **Information Disclosure** | Reading `/keys.db` file directly | All data encrypted with strong symmetric encryption |
| **Denial of Service** | File deletion or filesystem corruption | Physical recovery mode and backups |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Gaining access to all secrets | Context-based segmentation and per-entry authentication (future) |

---

## 🔐 Phase 3: Security by Design

- **Symmetric encryption**: AES-CBC with 16-byte blocks
- **Authentication**: SHA256 + salt hash of master key
- **Data integrity**: Ensured via IV separation and optional HMAC (future)
- **Storage control**:
  - CircuitPython has exclusive write access when in secure mode
  - RGB LED indicates storage state: 🔴 CircuitPython-writeable, 🔵 PC-writeable
- **Separation of concerns**: clean modular architecture
